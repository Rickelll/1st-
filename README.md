# Retail Sales Data Analysis

This project has been made as part of a milestone project with the Data Analytic & AI course provided by Code Institute.
It demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow, including Extracting, Transforming and Loading (ETL) data, as well as data visualisation using descriptive, trend, impact and comparative analysis.

The project guides you step by step through the entire process, from data cleaning to feature engineering, clearly explaining each stage.

## Dataset Content

This Dataset is sourced from [kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset)

The Project uses dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of three CSV files:
- *Stores Dataset- Stores Number of Store, Types and Size of Store*
- *Sales Dataset- Weekly Sales data by Store, Department and Date*
- *Features Dataset- External Store data such as Holidays, CPI and Markdown*
    - *Date*
    - *Type of Store*

    - *CPI*
    - *Unemployment*
    - *Markdwon 1-5*

## Dataset Characteristics
- *45 stores*
- *Multiple departments*
- *Varying date ranges per store*
- *Contains missing values*
- *Covers January 2010 to October 2012*
- *Contains missing values that require cleaning and preprocessing*

## Agile Methodology
- *In the beginning of the project I decided to create Kanban project, to keep track of progression. The idea is to help me in following a direction while building this project.*
-  *The Kanban Table Project can be found [here.](https://github.com/users/Rickelll/projects/8/views/1)*

## Business Requirements
The ultimate goal is to understand how our holidays, store types and time impact each of our stores performances, Finding this insight on our data can lead to better business strategies as well as better management across all of our stores.

The core business questions addressed by this project are:
1. What are our busiest times of the year?
2. How do sales trends evolve over time across different stores?
3. Are there differences in performance between stores and store types?
4. Do markdowns differ between holiday and non-holiday weeks?
